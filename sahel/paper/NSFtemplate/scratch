impact of soil/veg params in sahel SEBEX
It was found that proper parameter estimation of leaf area index, stomatal resistance,
and hydraulic conductivity allow enough evaporation to occur in land surface simulations
Observational data sets from the Sahelian Energy Balance Experiment (SEBEX) and the Hydrological Atmospheric Pilot
Experiment (HAPEX-Sahel)
Land cover change can affect the climate by altering the partitioning of
available energy between sensible and latent heat and by changing the partitioning of precipitation
between evapotranspiration and runoff
According to Wallace et al.
(1991), data describing Sahelian vegetation was very
sparse. Therefore, information about the energy and
water balances in the Sahel was urgently needed.
SEBEX was conducted with the goal of attaining
direct measurements of surface energy fluxes from
varying Sahelian land types. HAPEX-Sahel was
conducted in Niger, West Africa, in 1991–1993 with
the purpose of improving parameterizations of land
surface atmosphere interaction on the scale of a GCM
grid box.
78% of the vegetation was
comprised of leguminous and grass species (Cassia
mimosoides, Tephrosia linearis, Aristida mutabills,
and Eragrsostis tremula). The remainder was woody
shrubs about 2.5 m in height (Guiera senegalensis and
Combretum glutinosum) with a few occasional trees
(1.5 per hectare) of 5–10 m in height. The soil tends to
be very sandy and about 0.5 m deep.
The experiments described utilize the Simplified
Simple Biosphere Model (SSiB) (Xue et al., 1991)
Because HAPEX observations were taken inten-
sively for 8 weeks, producing a complete set of flux
measurements for the whole study period, the HAPEX
set was used for model parameter calibration (Section 6).
The SEBEX set contains 2 years of forcing data and
was used for validation (Section 6) and sensitivity
testing (Section 5) to guide/evaluate the calibration
process. The control run for HAPEX (referred to as
H-1) employed parameters for standard type-8
vegetation (Table 2), shrubs with ground-cover
(Dorman and Sellers, 1989), which is normally used
in GCMs for the Sahel area.
Although changing
albedo had a major impact in the sensitivity tests, it
was not desirable to alter this parameter in the
calibration since the type-8 vegetation already
represented an albedo similar to that observed at the
HAPEX site. The primary parameters discussed in
this section and adjusted in the final calibration are as
follows: leaf area index (LAI), stomatal resistance,
soil hydraulic conductivity at saturation, and soil
thermal diffusivity.

Runoff/LH most affected by LAI and stomatal resistance and soil hydraulic cond

In uncalibrated runs LH severely underestimated

The increase in LAI and
reduction in stomatal resistance allowed for more
transport of moisture from the land surface to the
atmosphere. This change in latent heat flux also served
to reduce sensible heat flux, bringing them both much
closer to observations, with significantly reduced RMS
errors. On a diurnal scale, the greatest difference
between the control and experimental runs exists
during the day; on a monthly scale, there appears to be
the greatest difference during the wet months.

effect of hernage on milk production

Offering a low DHA restricted grass dry matter intake (DMI) during R1 and R2 yet concentrate supplementation significantly increased total
DMI (2.3 (R1) and 3.0 (R2) kg DM/cow). Animals offered a low DHA had a significantly lower bodyweight (BW) than those offered a
medium or high DHA during P1 and P2. Concentrate supplementation increased BW during P1 and P2 (+9 and +14 kg/cow, respectively).
There was no effect of treatment on BW during P3. There was no effect of DHA on EB in R1; during R2 animals offered a low DHA had the
lowest EB. Concentrate significantly increased EB in R1 and R2 and increased plasma glucose concentration while it decreased plasma
NEFA and BHB concentrations. The results of this study indicate that animals should be offered a low DHA up to 80 DIM after which DHA
should be increased however animals should also be supplemented with concentrate during the early post-partum period.

The wooded grassland is the most widespread vegetation type on
sandy soils in the southern Sahel, where annual rainfall ranges from 250 mm to 500 mm per year. Typical woody species
include Acacia tortilis, which is most common, as well as A. laeta, Commiphora africana, Balanites aegyptiaca and Boscia
senegalensis. Grass cover is continuous, with annual species such as Cenchrus biflorus, Schoenefeldia gracilis, and
Aristida stipoides well­represented. In the northern Sahel, grasslands grow on deep, sandy soils, with some woody species.
Typical species include Acacia spp., and Boscia senegalensis. Perennial desert species, such as Panicum turgidum and
Aristida sieberana, alternate with typical Sahelian grassland (MH/E, WWF and IUCN 1996).

Few studies examine impact of grazing impacts on stream water quality, habitat change vs BMPs

Owens et al. (1989) stated that increases in sedi-
ment transport from a continuously grazed site in
Ohio might justify the use of exclusion fencing along
fragile riparian areas. Although not directly
attributable to stream fencing, Brannan et al. (2000)
postulated that total suspended solid loads and flow
weighted concentration reductions in a Virginia
watershed were the result of exclusion fencing. In a
later study, Owens et al. (1996) examined the effects
of stream fencing on sediment losses in an Ohio
stream located in a heavily grazed watershed. The
researchers noted a 57 percent decrease in the annual
flow weighted averages for sediment concentration
and more than a 40 percent decrease in average
annual soil losses when cattle were fenced out of the
stream. Line et al. (2000) evaluated the effectiveness
of exclusion fencing combined with planting trees to
reduce pollutant loads to a small North Carolina
stream, and noted significant reductions in total sus-
pended solid (82.3 percent) and total solid (81.7 per-
cent) loads.

productivities of range, crop, livestock are linked
graze range - fertilize crops
examine sustain nutrient cycling - examining impact on rangeland structure/composition, and nutrient balance
rangeland is equilibrium but cropland is in deficit
livestock must be managed to not deplete range but also supply cropland
requires alternative feeds from cropland
inihibited livestock mobility due to tnure policies inhibit farmer access to manure


nomadic->sedentary shift means more reliance on supplemental feed

encroahcment of croplands reduces rangeland

In the Sahel, livestock are the principal vectors of nutrient transfer
across the landscape. The cycling of biomass through livestock, and the
use of manure and urine to fertilize the soil, has long been an important
linkage between livestock and soil productivity in semi-arid Africa

rainfall variablility should prevent overgrazing

Although frequent grazing can reduce the dry matter (DM)
production of annual grasses by 50%, cumulative plant nitrogen (N) and
phosphorus (P) uptake in grazed areas is equal to, or is slightly greater
than nutrient uptake in ungrazed controls

Grazing, especially of annual grasses during the dry season, results in
DM losses due to trampling. This return of litter to soils enhances seed
germination and seedling establishment at the start of the following rainy
season (Renard et a/., 1993) and is important to cycling nutrients in these
rangeland systems

When grazing pressure remains high, especially on annual plants, flowering and the production
of seeds can be substantially reduced, threatening the propagation of the plant species over years

Many of the annual plants promoted by heavy grazing have low production potential
due to their small size and short growing cycle

This
study continues to show that the influence of grazing history on plant
communities is only conspicuous in situations of extreme livestock pres-
sure: in the vicinity of camps, watering points and other livestock resting
and concentration points. Elsewhere, the influence of grazing on the flor-
istic composition of these range sites is masked by the strong interaction
between seed germination, plant establishment and the distribution of the
early rains

Organizing the
seasonal mobility of livestock to avoid continuous grazing during
the growing season could overcome such a regressive trend. Exploiting the
feed quality gradient across the landscape (Westoby et al., 1989; Scoones,
1994) provides some flexibility for management at local scales while
preserving the ecosystem resilience.

vegetation removal and trampling can reduce infiltration and increase runoff
On a regional scale, even in situations of intense grazing pressure,
N exports from rangelands remain lower or equivalent to N inputs
(Diarra et al., 1995; de Leeuw et al., 1995). The amount of N removed
through grazing appears to be compensated by that returned through
trampling, plant roots and various natural sources

Given the lack of alternative dry season feeds, crop residues will continue
to provide vital livestock feeds in mixed farming systems of the Sahel.
Sustainable increases in livestock production, while protecting rangelands
against overgrazing will depend, therefore, on sustainable increases in
crop productivity. Continuous N removals without adequate replenish-
ment result in soil nutrient mining (Stoorvogel & Samling, 1990), and both
crop and livestock yields will eventually decline.
Of prime
interest to achieving sustainable increases in crop and livestock production
would be estimates of the amount of external nutrients (fertilizer and/or
livestock manure) required to offset internal nutrient deficits.

In Mali, for example, farmers who cultivate subsistence crops with com-
mercial rice and cotton appear to apply sufficient fertilizers to offset
internal nutrient deficits (Powell & Coulibaly, 1995). The same authors
estimated that farmers relying on rainfed crop production in semi-arid
areas could offset N harvests by applying two to four sacks of fertilizer
($28-70) per hectare of cropland, or applying more N in the form
of manure. Many of these farmers currently engage transhumant herders
to corral their animals on fields, so they may already be attaining N
balances on their croplands.


Fertilizer N sources need to be appropriate to specific soils, crops and rainfall conditions.
Fertilizers arc much more effective when applied in combination with organic fertilizer
sources (manures, compost, crop residues, etc.) and if proper management
is used to apply them. Before advocating an increase in herd size. more information
would be needed on current rangeland and cropland carrying capacities
and stocking rates, especially the ability of rangelands to
support more animals for manuring cropland.

Localized rainfall shortages
can easily be accommodated by moving animals to areas with better
rainfall. This opportunity becomes limited, however, when drought is widespread.
Apart from its negative effect on livestock numbers, drought may also
influence the type of livestock kept by farmers. Cattle, sheep and goats
have varying degrees of susceptibility to drought. During drought, small
ruminants, particularly goats, have a higher survival rate than cattle

Pastoralism will continue to provide not only food security and income to
herders and farmers alike, but also a vital supply of manure for maintaining
the productivity of cropland.

The capacity of rangelands to support livestock and nutrient harvesting
needs to be assessed at various rangeland:cropland
ratios,

Corralling livestock on cropland should be more widely
encouraged where soils are sandy and the risk of soil compaction due to
animal trampling is minimal.

The manure of transhumant herds remains vital to sustaining cropland productivity
in many rangeland/cropland farming systems. Access to manure and, therefore,
transhumance  needs to be encouraged in these production
systems. Factors that inhibit livestock movement, and there-
fore, farmers’ access to the manure of transhumant herds, will greatly
increase the need for other external nutrient inputs such as fertilizers to
prevent declines in soil fertility and crop yields

Natural fluxes in pasture productivity and livestock
numbers due to erratic rainfall and drought should not be disrupted.
Policies that advocate the purposeful supplemental feeding of animals during drought.
or rapid restocking during post-drought years could easily offset these
natural balances, degrade rangelands, and undermine the sustainability
of these production systems.

@article{graef2001spatial}

The variability in rainfall in semi-arid Niger is great both spatially and tem-
porally and is considered to be one of the most limiting factors in agriculture.
To investigate these constraints more quantitatively, climate data at both
survey and detailed scale were analysed. The results show that rainfall can vary
considerably even within a few kilometres distance and on different time
scales which means that crop yields are very unpredictable. Socio-economic
surveys at two villages showed that smallholders have adapted a range of
management strategies to ensure at least a minimum yield. Despite this, soil
fertility is declining and further technologies need to be integrated into farming
systems to make them sustainable.

Increasing land shortage has forced the farmers to shorten their fallow
periods from the traditional average of about 15 years to 2–5 years at present (Wezel,
1998) which leads to a higher land use intensity. This aggravates the problem of nutrient
mining and decreases soil productivity. Because manure is limited and the farmers’
economic situation enables the application of only small quantities of fertilizer the
farmers are not able to balance the nutrient deficits, creating a negative trend in future
soil fertility. There is some evidence that the most limiting factors on the sandy soils of
semi-arid Niger are the levels of phosphorus and nitrogen rather than water supply
(Payne et al., 1991), but other studies on heavy-textured (e.g. Lowenberg-DeBoer et al.,
1994) or superficially crusted soils (e.g. Valentin & Casenave, 1992) with low infiltration
rates emphasised the increasing importance of water management in drought-prone
areas.

Estimating the effects of land degradation and rainfall
variation on productivity in rangelands: an approach
using remote sensing and models of grazing and herbage
dynamics

Land degradation in non-equilibrium rangelands may be defined in terms of loss
of resilience and is linked with lower economic productivity through reduction in
forage consumption by stock.
2. Loss of resilience may be represented by lower water use efficiency and increased
tree and shrub cover, in a simple herbage production and consumption model. The
model may be calibrated from remotely sensed data.
3. Model calibration for rangeland areas in central Australia yields parameter values
for degraded and undegraded situations, allowing estimation of productivity.
4. Modelling of a 50-year rainfall sequence shows that herbage production and con-
sumption by cattle change through time because of rainfall variability. They also
change with paddock layout and access to water.
5. The effect of degradation on herbage consumption is relatively small compared
with the effects of rainfall variability, but it increases the chance of running out of
forage during drought.
