impact of soil/veg params in sahel SEBEX
It was found that proper parameter estimation of leaf area index, stomatal resistance,
and hydraulic conductivity allow enough evaporation to occur in land surface simulations
Observational data sets from the Sahelian Energy Balance Experiment (SEBEX) and the Hydrological Atmospheric Pilot
Experiment (HAPEX-Sahel)
Land cover change can affect the climate by altering the partitioning of
available energy between sensible and latent heat and by changing the partitioning of precipitation
between evapotranspiration and runoff
According to Wallace et al.
(1991), data describing Sahelian vegetation was very
sparse. Therefore, information about the energy and
water balances in the Sahel was urgently needed.
SEBEX was conducted with the goal of attaining
direct measurements of surface energy fluxes from
varying Sahelian land types. HAPEX-Sahel was
conducted in Niger, West Africa, in 1991–1993 with
the purpose of improving parameterizations of land
surface atmosphere interaction on the scale of a GCM
grid box.
78% of the vegetation was
comprised of leguminous and grass species (Cassia
mimosoides, Tephrosia linearis, Aristida mutabills,
and Eragrsostis tremula). The remainder was woody
shrubs about 2.5 m in height (Guiera senegalensis and
Combretum glutinosum) with a few occasional trees
(1.5 per hectare) of 5–10 m in height. The soil tends to
be very sandy and about 0.5 m deep.
The experiments described utilize the Simplified
Simple Biosphere Model (SSiB) (Xue et al., 1991)
Because HAPEX observations were taken inten-
sively for 8 weeks, producing a complete set of flux
measurements for the whole study period, the HAPEX
set was used for model parameter calibration (Section 6).
The SEBEX set contains 2 years of forcing data and
was used for validation (Section 6) and sensitivity
testing (Section 5) to guide/evaluate the calibration
process. The control run for HAPEX (referred to as
H-1) employed parameters for standard type-8
vegetation (Table 2), shrubs with ground-cover
(Dorman and Sellers, 1989), which is normally used
in GCMs for the Sahel area.
Although changing
albedo had a major impact in the sensitivity tests, it
was not desirable to alter this parameter in the
calibration since the type-8 vegetation already
represented an albedo similar to that observed at the
HAPEX site. The primary parameters discussed in
this section and adjusted in the final calibration are as
follows: leaf area index (LAI), stomatal resistance,
soil hydraulic conductivity at saturation, and soil
thermal diffusivity.

Runoff/LH most affected by LAI and stomatal resistance and soil hydraulic cond

In uncalibrated runs LH severely underestimated

The increase in LAI and
reduction in stomatal resistance allowed for more
transport of moisture from the land surface to the
atmosphere. This change in latent heat flux also served
to reduce sensible heat flux, bringing them both much
closer to observations, with significantly reduced RMS
errors. On a diurnal scale, the greatest difference
between the control and experimental runs exists
during the day; on a monthly scale, there appears to be
the greatest difference during the wet months.

effect of hernage on milk production

Offering a low DHA restricted grass dry matter intake (DMI) during R1 and R2 yet concentrate supplementation significantly increased total
DMI (2.3 (R1) and 3.0 (R2) kg DM/cow). Animals offered a low DHA had a significantly lower bodyweight (BW) than those offered a
medium or high DHA during P1 and P2. Concentrate supplementation increased BW during P1 and P2 (+9 and +14 kg/cow, respectively).
There was no effect of treatment on BW during P3. There was no effect of DHA on EB in R1; during R2 animals offered a low DHA had the
lowest EB. Concentrate significantly increased EB in R1 and R2 and increased plasma glucose concentration while it decreased plasma
NEFA and BHB concentrations. The results of this study indicate that animals should be offered a low DHA up to 80 DIM after which DHA
should be increased however animals should also be supplemented with concentrate during the early post-partum period.

Higher soil C in grazed pastures higher soil C with grazing reult of more rapid shoot turnover and resditribution of C within plant-soil system as a result of changes in species compostition

restoring hetereogeneity on rangelands with evolutionary grazing patterns

spatial heterogeneity due to out of phase succession from various disturbances(fire, graze)

near water, high grazing, livestock select areas with less accumulation from previous years

overgraze results in decreased infiltration and increased runoff

rotational grazing encourages homogeneity

how to encourage heterogeneity/species diversity?

fire - intense grazing on burned patches allows unburned to regrow

no graze - homogeneous
heavy graze - reduces most biomass - defoliated - everything eaten

oklahoma bison experiment

 In fact, bison have maintained high re-
productive rates without nutritional supplementation (Robert
Hamilton [The Nature Conservancy], personal communi-
cation, 1999), in contrast to cattle, whose reproductive rates
in the absence of protein supplementation decline consider-
ably when dominant forage grasses mature under traditional
rangeland management (Hughes et al. 1978, McCollum and
Horn 1990). 

though minor differences in biodiversity when bison and cattle are grazed similarly

Few studies examine impact of grazing impacts on stream water quality, habitat change vs BMPs

Owens et al. (1989) stated that increases in sedi-
ment transport from a continuously grazed site in
Ohio might justify the use of exclusion fencing along
fragile riparian areas. Although not directly
attributable to stream fencing, Brannan et al. (2000)
postulated that total suspended solid loads and flow
weighted concentration reductions in a Virginia
watershed were the result of exclusion fencing. In a
later study, Owens et al. (1996) examined the effects
of stream fencing on sediment losses in an Ohio
stream located in a heavily grazed watershed. The
researchers noted a 57 percent decrease in the annual
flow weighted averages for sediment concentration
and more than a 40 percent decrease in average
annual soil losses when cattle were fenced out of the
stream. Line et al. (2000) evaluated the effectiveness
of exclusion fencing combined with planting trees to
reduce pollutant loads to a small North Carolina
stream, and noted significant reductions in total sus-
pended solid (82.3 percent) and total solid (81.7 per-
cent) loads.
