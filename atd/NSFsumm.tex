\required{Project Summary}
Problem of threat detection
disaster, explosive, weapon accident
Available sensing mmodalities
chemical, rf, imageproc, fusion
Unexploited RF - pervasive rf

No interpretive framework
rssi-fingerprint
model received power as a random process, with underlying hidden state to be estimated

\required{Overview}
% This should be a brief description of the activity 
% that would result if the proposal were funded 
% and a statement of objectives and methods to be employed.
% It should look something like an abstract. 
Employ passive rf sensnsors in different comm bands

Interpret received power: kriging weighted by transmitting location

Map of received power is random process

Underlying state machine reveals threat
\cite{sigg2014rf}

\required{Intellectual Merit}
% This should describe the potential of the proposed activity
% to advance knowledge in the field of mathematics. 
Unused dataset

Reflects information traffic

optical dlow as information flow, governed by state

will give a new interpretive mathematical framework for unused dataset

\required{Broader Impacts}
% This should describe the potential of the proposed activity
% to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of 
% specific, desired societal outcomes.
% Examples of Broader Imacts include, but are not limited to:
% 1. Full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and 
% underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, 
% and mathematics (STEM); 
% 2. Improved STEM education and educator 
% development at any level; 
% 3. Increased public scientific literacy 
% and public engagement with science and technology; 
% 4. Improved well-being of individuals in society; 
% 5. Development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce;
% 6. Increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; 
% 7. Improved national security; 
% 8. Increased economic competitiveness of the US; 
% 9. Enhanced infrastructure for research and education.
Improved safety
