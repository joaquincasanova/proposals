Considerations:

-safety
-thermal/non-thermal
-penetration
-power level
-specificity

for magnetic particles:

-low frequency = higher penetration
-difficulty is ensure adequate temperature rise and selective uptake of magnetic particles by C. Asiatictus

for GHz radiation:

-shown to induce phage in lysogenic E. Coli
-poor canopy/trunk penetration

webb 1979

-lysogenic e.coli growth media x incubation duration x microwave frequency and power
-in BHIB (good nutrition)/0.25 mW/cm2/70.3-70.5 GHz -> lambda induction
-a threshold of esposure and a certain metabolic state necessary to induce phage
-max effect at 0.5 mW/cm2

-magnetic particle hyperthermia in tumours
-heating mechanisms hysteresis vs viscous
-depends on relaxation time -there are two Neel and Brown. functions of particle size
-the faster relaxation time will dominate
-single vs multidomain particles ~30nm
-single domain has greater hysteresis loss, greater heating
-higher frequency->Neel losses, lower->Brown (both sub MHz)
-higher size->Brown losses, lower->Neel
-also resonances in GHz range
-example specific loss power: 1650 W/g f=700 kHz H=24.8 kA/m (Fortin et al 2007)
-formation methods, materials
	-magnetite, maghemite
	-laser evaporation, wet chemical, biomineralization (promising - best SLP)
-coating prevents agglomeration, biocompatibility, functionalization
-tumour heating goes up with tumour size because smaller tomours have greater surface area to volume.

hoffman et al 2013

-thermal treatment of HLB
-tested different citrus varieties, budwood vs established plants, temperature duration and levels
-elevated temperatures eliminate C. Asiaticus
-both 40C 24h or 42/30C 19/5h
-2-6 days
-results in plant damage but vigorous regrowth after treatment

ushakov et al 1999

-circularly polarized mm-wave on E. Coli
-1 W/m2
-EtBr 1ug/ml (intercalates DNA supercoils; test idea that microwaves are targeting DNA structural resonances)
-without EtBr, LCHP kills E.Coli ~51GHz
-with EtBr, both RHCP and LHCP work but not as well
-suggests DNA is target and polarization selectivity is rrelated to DNA helicity of supersructure (EtBR stabilizes B-form [right] DNA, as opposed to Z-form [left])

ehsani et. al 2015

-mobile heat treatment
-60 C for a few minutes
